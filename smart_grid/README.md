# Smart Grid Power Flow Analysis

This project simulates **power flow in a smart grid network** using the **Maximum Flow algorithm** on a weighted directed graph.

## Features

- Multiple generators and loads (sources and sinks)
- Transmission lines represented as edges with capacities
- Maximum power flow calculation using **Edmonds-Karp algorithm**
- Visualization of the smart grid with capacities
- Easy to extend for scenarios like line failures or dynamic capacity changes
